                   years has made data and methods more reproducible and
                   transparent. This openness has led to transformative insights
                   and vastly accelerated scientific progress. For example,
                   structural biology and genomics have undertaken systematic
                   collection and publication of protein sequences and
                   structures over the past half-century, and these data have
                   led to scientific breakthroughs that were unthinkable when
                   data collection first began. We believe that neuroscience is
                   poised to follow the same path, and that principles of open
                   data and open science will transform our understanding of the
                   nervous system in ways that are impossible to predict at the
                   moment. To this end, new social structures along with active
                   and open scientific communities are essential to facilitate
                   and expand the still limited adoption of open science
                   practices in our field. Unified by shared values of openness,
                   we set out to organize a symposium for Open Data in
                   Neuroscience (ODIN) to strengthen our community and
                   facilitate transformative neuroscience research at large. In
                   this report, we share what we learned during this first ODIN
                   event. We also lay out plans for how to grow this movement,
                   document emerging conversations, and propose a path toward a
                   better and more transparent science of tomorrow.",

               licenses for public sharing have existed since the late 20s
               century. More recent worldwide efforts have led to an increase in
               the amount of data shared: funding agencies require that data are
               shared, journals request that data are made available, and some
               journals publish papers describing data resources. For
               intracranial EEG (iEEG) data, considering how and when to share
               data does not happen only at the stage of publication. Human
               subjects’ rights demand that data sharing is something that
               should be considered when writing an ethical protocol and
               designing a study before data are collected. At that moment, it
               should already be considered what levels of data will be
               collected and potentially shared. This includes levels of data
               directly from the amplifier, reformatted or processed data,
               clinical information and imaging data. In this chapter we will
               describe considerations and scholarship behind sharing iEEG data,
               to make it easier for the iEEG community to share data for
               reproducibility, teaching, advancing computational efforts,

               infrastructure and development project designed both to begin the
               establishment of an operational Virtual Observatory (VO) and to
               provide the US coordination with the international VO effort. The
               concept of the VO is to provide the means by which an astronomer
               is able to discover, access, and process data seamlessly,
               regardless of its physical location. This paper describes the
               origins of the VAO, including the predecessor efforts within the
               US National Virtual Observatory, and summarizes its main
               accomplishments. These accomplishments include the development of
               both scripting toolkits that allow scientists to incorporate VO
               data directly into their reduction and analysis environments and
               high-level science applications for data discovery, integration,
               analysis, and catalog cross-comparison. Working with the
               international community, and based on the experience from the
               software development, the VAO was a major contributor to
               international standards within the International Virtual
               Observatory Alliance. The VAO also demonstrated how an
               operational virtual observatory could be deployed, providing a
               robust operational environment in which VO services worldwide
               were routinely checked for aliveness and compliance with
               international standards. Finally, the VAO engaged in community
               outreach, developing a comprehensive web site with on-line
               tutorials, announcements, links to both US and internationally
               developed tools and services, and exhibits and hands-on training
               at annual meetings of the American Astronomical Society and
               through summer schools and community days. All digital products
               of the VAO Project, including software, documentation, and
               tutorials, are stored in a repository for community access. The
               enduring legacy of the VAO is an increasing expectation that new
               telescopes and facilities incorporate VO capabilities during the
               design of their data management systems.",

               adopted by astronomers in the early 1980s to overcome
               incompatibilities between operating systems. On the back of FITS’
               success, astronomical data became both backward compatible and
               easily shareable. However, new advances in the astronomical
               instrumentation, computational technologies, and analytic
               techniques have resulted in new data that do not work well within
               the traditional FITS format. Tensions have arisen between the
               desire to update the format to meet new analytic challenges and
               adherence to the original edict for the FITS file format to be
               backward compatible. We examine three inflection points in the

              requires integration of data across this diversity, and thus
              these data must be findable, accessible, interoperable, and
              reusable (FAIR). This requires a standard language for data and

              defines and modularizes the interdependent, yet separable,
              components of a data language. We demonstrate NWB's impact
              through unified description of neurophysiology data across
              diverse modalities and species. NWB exists in an ecosystem, which
              includes data management, analysis, visualization, and archive
              tools. Thus, the NWB data language enables reproduction,
              interchange, and reuse of diverse neurophysiology data. More
              broadly, the design principles of NWB are generally applicable to

              diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive
              study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used
              to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no

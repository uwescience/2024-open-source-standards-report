               recognized in academia and is reflected in the recent rise of job
               opportunities for data scientists and research software
               engineers. Big data, for example, created a wave of novel job
               descriptions before the term Data Scientist (DS) was widely used.
               And even though software has become a major driver for research
               (Nangia and Katz, 2017), Research Software Engineer (RSE) as a
               formal role has lagged behind in terms of job openings,
               recognition, and prominence within the community. Despite their
               importance in the academic research ecosystem, the value of DS
               and RSE roles is not yet widely understood or appreciated in the
               academic community, and research data, software, and workflows
               are, in many domains, still regarded as by-products of research.
               Data Scientists and Research Software Engineers (DS/RSEs) face
               similar challenges when it comes to career paths in academia -
               both are non-traditional academic professions with few incentives
               and a lack of clear career trajectories. This guidebook presents
               the challenges and suggestions for solutions to improve the
               situation and to reach a wide community of stakeholders needed to
               advance career paths for DS/RSEs.",

               company experiences integrating with electronic health records
               (EHRs), given new federally regulated standards-based application
               programming interface (API) policies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
               developed and fielded a survey among companies that develop
               solutions enabling human interaction with an EHR API. The survey
               was developed by the University of California San Francisco in
               collaboration with the Office of the National Coordinator for
               Health Information Technology, the California Health Care
               Foundation, and ScaleHealth. The instrument contained questions
               pertaining to experiences with API integrations, barriers faced
               during API integrations, and API-relevant policy efforts.
               RESULTS: About 73\% of companies reported current or previous use
               of a standards-based EHR API in production. About 57\% of
               respondents indicated using both standards-based and proprietary
               APIs to integrate with an EHR, and 24\% worked about equally with
               both APIs. Most companies reported use of the Fast Healthcare
               Interoperability Resources standard. Companies reported that
               standards-based APIs required on average less burden than
               proprietary APIs to establish and maintain. However, companies
               face barriers to adopting standards-based APIs, including high
               fees, lack of realistic clinical testing data, and lack of data
               elements of interest or value. DISCUSSION: The industry is moving
               toward the use of standardized APIs to streamline data exchange,
               with a majority of digital health companies using standards-based
               APIs to integrate with EHRs. However, barriers persist.
               CONCLUSION: A large portion of digital health companies use
               standards-based APIs to interoperate with EHRs. Continuing to
               improve the resources for digital health companies to find, test,
               connect, and use these APIs ``without special effort'' will be
               crucial to ensure future technology robustness and durability.",

                   transparent. This openness has led to transformative insights
                   and vastly accelerated scientific progress. For example,
                   structural biology and genomics have undertaken systematic
                   collection and publication of protein sequences and
                   structures over the past half-century, and these data have
                   led to scientific breakthroughs that were unthinkable when
                   data collection first began. We believe that neuroscience is
                   poised to follow the same path, and that principles of open
                   data and open science will transform our understanding of the
                   nervous system in ways that are impossible to predict at the

               journals publish papers describing data resources. For
               intracranial EEG (iEEG) data, considering how and when to share
               data does not happen only at the stage of publication. Human

               establishment of an operational Virtual Observatory (VO) and to
               provide the US coordination with the international VO effort. The
               concept of the VO is to provide the means by which an astronomer
               is able to discover, access, and process data seamlessly,
               regardless of its physical location. This paper describes the
               origins of the VAO, including the predecessor efforts within the
               US National Virtual Observatory, and summarizes its main
               accomplishments. These accomplishments include the development of
               both scripting toolkits that allow scientists to incorporate VO
               data directly into their reduction and analysis environments and
               high-level science applications for data discovery, integration,
               analysis, and catalog cross-comparison. Working with the
               international community, and based on the experience from the
               software development, the VAO was a major contributor to
               international standards within the International Virtual
               Observatory Alliance. The VAO also demonstrated how an
               operational virtual observatory could be deployed, providing a
               robust operational environment in which VO services worldwide
               were routinely checked for aliveness and compliance with
               international standards. Finally, the VAO engaged in community
               outreach, developing a comprehensive web site with on-line
               tutorials, announcements, links to both US and internationally
               developed tools and services, and exhibits and hands-on training
               at annual meetings of the American Astronomical Society and
               through summer schools and community days. All digital products
               of the VAO Project, including software, documentation, and
               tutorials, are stored in a repository for community access. The
               enduring legacy of the VAO is an increasing expectation that new
               telescopes and facilities incorporate VO capabilities during the
               design of their data management systems.",

# Recommendations

We make the following recommendations:


1. Training for data stewards and career paths that encourage this role.
2. Development of meta-standards or standards-of-standards. These are descriptions of cross-cutting best-practices. These can be used as a basis of the analysis or assessment of an existing standard, or as guidelines to develop new standards.
3. Recommend pathways or lifecycles for successful data standards. Include process, creators, affiliations, grants, and adoption journeys. Make this documentation step integral to the work of standards creators and granting agencies. 
4. Retrocactively document #3 for standards such as CF(climate science), NASA genelab (space omics), OpenGIS (geospatial), DICOM (medical imaging), GA4GH (genomics), FITS (astronomy), Zarr (domain agnostic n-dimensional arrays)... ?
5. Create ontology for standards process such as top down vs bottom up, minimum number of datasets, community size. Examine schema.org (w3c), PEP (Python), CDISC (FDA).
6. Amplify formalization/guidelines on how to create standards (example metadata schema specifications using https://linkml.io).
7. Make software creation an integral part of establishing a standard's schema e.g. identifiers for a person using CFF in citations. cffconvert software makes the CFF standard usable and useful. 
8. Survey and document failure of current standards for a specific dataset / domain before establishing a new one. Use resources such as Fairsharing.org or Digital Curation Center https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards. 
7. Funding agencies and science communities need to establish governance for standards creation and adoption (cite https://www.theopensourceway.org/the_open_source_way-guidebook-2.0.html#_project_and_community_governance).
8. Cross sector alliances such as industry - academia need closer coordination and algnment of pace through strong program management (for instance via OSPO efforts).
9. Multi company partnerships should include strategic initiatives for standard establishment (cite example https://www.pistoiaalliance.org/news/press-release-pistoia-alliance-launches-idmp-1-0/).

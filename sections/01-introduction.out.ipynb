    "Data-intensive discovery has become an important mode of knowledge production across many research fields and it is having a significant and broad impact across all of society. This is becoming increasingly salient as recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) promise to increase the value of large, multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data sources. Coupled with these new machine learning techniques, these datasets can help us understand everything from the cellular operations of the human body, through business transactions on the internet, to the structure and history of the universe. However, the development of new machine learning methods and data-intensive discovery more generally depends on Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability (FAIR) of data ([Wilkinson et al. 2016](#ref-Wilkinson2016FAIR)) as well as metadata ([Musen 2022](#ref-Musen2022metadata)). One of the main mechanisms through which the FAIR principles are promoted is the development of *standards* for data and metadata. Standards can vary in the level of detail and scope, and encompass such things as *file formats* for the storage of certain data types, *schemas* for databases that organize data, *ontologies* to describe and organize metadata in a manner that connects it to field-specific meaning, as well as mechanisms to describe *provenance* of analysis products.\n",

    "Community-driven development of robust, adaptable and useful standards draws significant inspiration from the development of open-source software (OSS) and has many parallels and overlaps with OSS development. OSS has a long history going back to the development of the Unix operating system in the late 1960s. Over the time since its inception, the large community of developers and users of OSS have developed a host of socio-technical mechanisms that support the development and use of OSS. For example, the Open Source Initiative (OSI), a non-profit organization that was founded in the 1990s developed a set of guidelines for licensing of OSS that is designed to protect the rights of developers and users. On the technical side, tools such as the Git Source-code management system support complex and distributed open-source workflows that accelerate, streamline, and robustify OSS development. Governance approaches have been honed to address the challenges of managing a range of stakeholder interests and to mediate between large numbers of weakly-connected individuals that contribute to OSS. When these social and technical innovations are put together they enable a host of positive defining features of OSS, such as transparency, collaboration, and decentralization. These features allow OSS to have a remarkable level of dynamism and productivity, while also retaining the ability of a variety of stakeholders to guide the evolution of the software to take their needs and interests into account.\n",

    "Data and metadata standards that use tools and practices of OSS (“open-source standards” henceforth) reap many of the benefits that the OSS model has provided in the development of other technologies. The present report explores how OSS processes and tools have affected the development of data and metadata standards. The report will triangulate common features of a variety of use cases; it will identify some of the challenges and pitfalls of this mode of standards development, with a particular focus on cross-sector interactions; and it will make recommendations for future developments and policies that can help this mode of standards development thrive and reach its full potential.\n",
